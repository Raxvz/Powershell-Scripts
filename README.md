# Powershell-Scripts

These PS scripts are made to speed up the process of screensharing (or PC checking wtv u like to call it).
Make sure to run all the scripts as admin as some of the scripts require admin perms to be able to do the work.
Also some of the scripts may not work if stored in .ps1 files, So run them in regular powershell as administrator perms.
